Intro
-----
**Charade** is an ssh-agent in [cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/) that proxies requests to [pageant](http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/0.60/htmldoc/Chapter9.html#pageant).

If you don't use cygwin or pageant, you don't need charade.  If you're happy with plink, you don't need charade.  (I love putty, but I prefer openssh to plink.)

**Background:** I tolerate Windows XP. I actually quite like it. But it needs putty, and it needs cygwin to be usable. I used to maintain two separate sets of ssh keys: one for putty, which I kept in pageant, and another for cygwin's openssh, which I kept in ssh-agent/keychain.

Eventually I got fed up maintaining two key pairs and charade was born.

Charade just pretends to be ssh-agent on one side and putty on the other. It's a shim between openssh and pageant.

It aspires to be a drop-in replacement for ssh-agent, and that's how I use it atm. It works for me. It probably won't work for you.

I stole large swaths of code from (i) Simon Tatham's putty (mostly [putty-src/windows/winpgntc.c](http://svn.tartarus.org/sgt/putty/)) and (ii) openssh's (and Tatu Ylonen's and Marcus Friedl's) ssh-agent.c.

Also check out [cuviper's ssh-pageant](http://github.com/cuviper/ssh-pageant), which does something similar.

Russell Davis has a clever way of [setting environment variables at boot](http://russelldavis.blogspot.com/2011/02/using-charade-to-proxy-cygwin-ssh-agent.html) so that processes launched outside your shells can also use your ssh keys.

Required cygwin packages
------------------------
* `gcc-g++`
* `make`
* `keychain`
* `openssh`
* `psmisc`

Installation instructions
-------------------------

1. Clone the repository

        git clone git://github.com/wesleyd/charade.git

2. Build and install charade
    
         make && make install

3. Stop running charade or ssh-agent processes

         killall charade   # Only if upgrading

         killall ssh-agent   # Only if not upgrading

4. Remove existing keychain files to clear references to ssh-agent

         rm -rf ~/.keychain


5. Add these two lines to ~/.bash_profile:

         keychain -q -Q

         . .keychain/`hostname`-sh

6. Logout, launch a new shell or putty and try it out
    
        ssh git@github.com

If you have a key in pageant, you should be able to go where it points.

It just forwards ssh messages, so surprising (to me!) things Just Work, like adding keys with ssh-add instead of through the pageant gui.
