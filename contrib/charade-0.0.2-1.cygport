NAME="charade"
VERSION=0.0.2
RELEASE=1
CATEGORY="Net"
SUMMARY="Ssh-agent clone for cygwin that proxies to pageant."
DESCRIPTION="Charade just pretends to be ssh-agent on one side and putty on the other. It's a shim between openssh and pageant.

It aspires to be a drop-in replacement for ssh-agent, and that's how I use it atm. It works for me. It probably won't work for you."
